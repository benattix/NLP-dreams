    "*First of all, the elephant in the room: how many topics do I need? There is really no easy answer for this, it will depend on both your data and your application. I have used 10 topics here because I wanted to have a few topics that I could interpret and \"label\", and because that turned out to give me reasonably good results. You might not need to interpret all your topics, so you could use a large number of topics, for example 100.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The `chunksize` controls how many documents are processed at a time in the training algorithm. Increasing chunksize will speed up training, at least as long as the chunk of documents easily fit into memory. I've set chunksize = 2000, which is more than the amount of documents, so I process all the data in one go. Chunksize can however influence the quality of the model, as discussed in Hoffman and co-authors [2], but the difference was not substantial in this case.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*`passes` controls how often we train the model on the entire corpus. Another word for passes might be \"epochs\". iterations is somewhat technical, but essentially it controls how often we repeat a particular loop over each document. It is important to set the number of \"passes\" and \"iterations\" high enough.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*I suggest the following way to choose iterations and passes. First, enable logging (as described in many Gensim tutorials), and set eval_every = 1 in LdaModel. When training the model look for a line in the log that looks something like this: *\n",

    "*If you set `passes` = 20 you will see this line 20 times. Make sure that by the final passes, most of the documents have converged. So you want to choose both passes and iterations to be high enough for this to happen.*\n",
